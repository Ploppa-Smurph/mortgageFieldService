<h1>National Mortgage Field Services</h1>    
<h2>Lesson 01: What Does a Field Inspector Do?</h2>
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never ask or inquire of the homeowner about the financial status of the loan.
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never collect or insist on payments be made.
    - Reasons for delinquency are not the responsibility of the Mortgage Field Service inspector.
    - Leaving a letter in a sealed envelope at the door for the homeowner to call the mortgage company may be required.
    - Some inspections are ordered simply to check for damages in a declared natural disaster area.

  Exterior property inspections are requested by the bank or mortgage company to determine:
    - The occupancy status
    - The condition of the property
    - If there is any deterioration or vandalism
    - If the property has been abandoned
    - If the property is listed for sale 


** Your mileage, your cell phone, your cell phone bill, your internet bill, the square footage of the room in your home where you set up your office, are all tax deductions just like any other business. **    
<h2>Lesson 02: The Mortgage Field Service Industry</h2>

   Tools to be successful:
    - A vehicle that gets good gas mileage.
    - A SmartPhone (Android or iPhone)
    - A Printer/Scanner
    - A Computer (Desktop, Tablet, Laptop, or your cell phone if you can print from it)
    - A Volt stick to check electricity at vacant properties – costs about $10
    - A set of HUD keys. Your client may be able to sell these to you at a very low-cost.
    - A clean criminal background record. (No Felony convictions) As an Independent Contractor, you will have to pay for this yourself.

** Never go to the backyards of occupied properties, no matter what the instructions tell you.  **

<b>A Mortgage Field Service Inspector does not engage in any debt or money collection services whatsoever. </b>

use of <b>InspectorADE</b> application on phone

 * Inspections on occupied properties cannot be conducted before 8 AM and not after 9 PM.

 <b>MileIQ</b> and <b>GetUpside</b> are good apps to keep up with mileage and to save on gasoline

 get paid every 30 - 125 days; invoice every 30 days
<h2>Lesson 03: The Basic Property Inspection</h2>
 It may be occupied if:
    - the doorbell is lit or porch light is on.
    - a water spigot near the front door when turn on has water coming out of it.
    - noises coming from the interior.
    - garbage cans set out for collection along with all the neighbors.
    - freshly cut and manicured lawns.
    - cars parked in the driveway.
    - personal property is seen on the exterior.
    - personal property is seen in the interior from the street.
    - holiday decorations.
    - flags or political signs.
    - pets or animals on the property.

*Never walk in the backyard of an occupied property!
** DO NOT knock on the front door of a Bankruptcy / No-Contact Inspection **
**** NEVER MENTION ****
    -- Late on Payments
    -- Delinquency
    -- Past Due
    -- Default
    -- In the rears
    -- FORECLOSURE

 It may be vacant if:
   - weeds are growing in the cracks of the driveway
   - all utilities appear to be off
   - tall grass or weeds
   - no signs of personal property
   - no window coverings
   - excess debris
   - newspapers and mail piled up

Steps to determining if occupied or not: 
    - Ring the doorbell, listen for sounds. If there is an electrical outlet near the front door, use your volt stick to check for power.
    - If there is a water spigot near the front door, see if the water is on or off.
    - Listen to the AC unit.
    - If the electric meter is on the side of the house in public view, see if it is operating.

 Examples of “No Access” would be:
   - A closed rural gate where you cannot see over the gate to get a view of the dwelling. If you can see the dwelling over the gate, then you have access.
   - (We do not open road gates.) Take a photo of the gate, and another of what is seen beyond the gate to show you cannot see the dwelling.
   - A gated community when you cannot get past the guard or it requires a code to open the gate.  That would be No Access.

 <b>Disaster Inspections</b>  
    Hurricane, Tornado, Wildfires, Earthquake, and Floods

 ** Under no circumstances are you to take photos of the interior of occupied properties, even if the homeowner invites you in. **   
 If the homeowner doesn’t want you taking photos of their property then don’t argue with them. Finish your report, make notes, and move on.  

 -- If the property is occupied, all occupancy and letter delivery inspections require at least 2 additional photos that support that the property is occupied. (Along with the 4 core photos.)
        <i>Car in Driveway, porch light, trash can day, personal property, lawn cut, pet in window, etc... </i>
<h2>Lesson 04: No-Contact and Bankruptcy Inspections</h2> 
<b>WHO EVER SPEAKS FIRST LOSES!</b>
    - If you are inspecting an occupied property and it is a No-Contact or Bankruptcy inspection and the occupant comes out and you say hello first, you just made contact!
        If on the other hand the occupant of the property comes out during your inspection asking what are you doing then they made contact with you which is not in violation with any bankruptcy laws. 
        - If they ask what you are doing you are authorized to say that you are conducting a property inspection for the mortgage company. If they ask anything else, tell them that you are not authorized to have this conversation, 
           (or not provided with that information), you’re just conducting a property inspection.
       
   * Every bankruptcy that involves the mortgage will be inspected once a month for the duration of the bankruptcy.  It is in every bankruptcy settlement written. *
   
<b>DO NOT STEP FOOT ON THE PROPERTY!</b>
   Even if it is vacant, we do not step foot on the property.  Take your photos from the street and leave.  If you are not sure if it is occupied or vacant, make your best guess.  We are not held accountable for judgment calls on bankruptcy and No-Contact inspections.  

   - In the comments section of the inspection form you can write:  “All observations made from roadside.”

  ** Do NOT leave door hangers, cards, envelopes, vacancy stickers, vacancy postings or any other postings on a property when the work code shows: No-Contact or Bankruptcy. **   
<h2>Lesson 05: Inspection Authority</h2>
Where do we get the authority to do what we do? 

In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, 

§ 203.377 Inspection and preservation of properties.

The mortgagee, (the bank or mortgage company) upon learning that a property subject to a mortgage insured under this part is vacant or abandoned, shall be responsible for the inspection of such property at least monthly, if the loan thereon is in default. When a mortgage is in default and a payment thereon is not received within 45 days of the due date,
  and efforts to reach the mortgagor by telephone within that period have been unsuccessful, the mortgagee shall be responsible for a visual inspection of the security property to determine whether the property is vacant. The mortgagee shall take reasonable action to protect and preserve such security property when it is determined or should have been 
  determined to be vacant or abandoned until its conveyance to the Secretary, if such action does not constitute an illegal trespass. ‘‘Reasonable action’’ includes the commencement of foreclosure within the time required by § 203.355(b) of this part.

** The best practice is to take the photo of the street sign first, before pulling up to the property. While you have your inspection open on your phone, and ready for the next photo, arrive at the property so that the house is on your left side. Have your window already rolled down. 
    As you pull up across the street, start snapping those photos before anyone comes out. Get the front, or in some cases, the front left, front, front right. (Depending on the client instructions.) Then zoom in on the address.  Hit your occupancy photos, cat in the window, toys in the yard, swing on the porch etc. **

    No need for getting out of your car. (Even though most companies will tell you not to take photos from your car) No need to cause a scene.

<b>No Tresspassing</b>    
Properties with “No Trespassing” signs can and often are treated in the same way as “no contact” inspections.

<b><i>In Louisiana, Title 14, RS 14:63 – Criminal Trespass Section F Shows person is not trespassing when:
  (3) Any person making a delivery, soliciting, selling any product or service, conducting a survey or poll, a real estate licensee or other person who has a legitimate reason for making a delivery, conducting business or communicating with the owner, lessee, custodian or a resident of the immovable property, 
  and who, immediately upon entry, seeks to make the delivery, to conduct business or to conduct the communication.</i></b>
<h2>Lesson 06: Letter Delivery</h2>
    Occasionally your client work order will include printing a letter for the homeowner, to be left at the front door in a sealed envelope. 
  <b>Place the envelope in the crack of the front door and take a photo of it at the property.</b>

  ** If the occupant happens to open the door, hand them the envelope and let them know that their mortgage company would like them to call.
  *** Do not take a photo of the homeowner or you handing the envelope to the homeowner.
  **** Under no circumstances are we to take photos of people, especially children. 

 When leaving a client’s letter inside a sealed envelope at the front door, write the word “Confidential” on the outside of the envelope.

 ** It is against the law to tape an open-faced, non-sealed letter on a debtor’s property. **

 We are never to leave a letter at a door before 8 AM and not after 9 PM.

 ** NEVER LEAVE DOOR HANGERS OR LETTERS INSIDE THE HOMEOWNERS MAILBOX! **

 we do not put ourselves in harm’s way to put a letter on a door.  Just mark down that you did not leave a letter because of “dogs”.  
   You MUST provide a photo of the dog to help prove your point.
<h2>Lesson 07: Basic Photo Requirements</h2>
Property Inspection requires at least 7 Core photos and 2-3 occupancy supporting photos if occupied for a total of 10 photos.
  (Some clients may indicate fewer photos based on the instructions); If the work order states that only 1 photo is required or that no photos are required, disregard and take a minimum of 6 photos.

- Core – Front, Front/Left and Front/Right
- Core – Address Number
- Core – Street Scene – Both directions
- Core – Street Sign
- 2 or 3 Occupancy Indicators (if occupied).

The (2) two required occupancy photos can be of anything that you see at the property that leads you to believe the property is occupied.  For Example:
    - Lights turned on (Exterior light, doorbell light, porch light, etc.)
    - Trash cans set out along with everyone else’s trash cans
    - Car in the driveway (Worst occupancy indicator. Neighbors often park their cars at vacant houses to make the house look occupied.)
    - Pets in window
    - Personal property
    - Volt stick photo at the front door (if available) showing electric is on
    - Vehicle tracks in mud or snow
    - Holiday decorations
    - Kids toys
    - Dog outside
    - Anything else that helps to prove the property is occupied

 <b>** Important Considerations:</b>
    - The photos we provide our clients must be clear and sharp.
    - Your cell phone must be set to the correct date and time.
    - Take photos with your cell phone held sideways to enable broad view photos. (Landscape)</b>

<b>*** On InspectorADE as well as the NMFS.com website in the Back Office there are two photos provided that you should download, print, and place back to back in a plastic protective sheet.
    Throw it in your vehicle to snap a photo of it if the property does not have an address or if the street sign is missing. ***</b>

 -- When taking front photos make sure you take the full front. Take a photo that covers the entire front roof line.  
  Make sure there is at least 5% air space on each side. That way your clients can see the entire width of the house.   

 <b>NO CAR PARTS IN THE PHOTO… EVER! Photos that have car parts will generate a Follow-Up which requires that you go back and take better photos.</b> 

- Never use photos from previous inspections!
- Never use photos from Google Maps or any other mapping program.
- Never use photos from realtor sites.
<h2>Lesson 08: Inspecting Vacant Properties</h2>
the word “vacant” could have several definitions. Some of them are:
    - Abandoned
    - Unoccupied
    - Vacant Possession
    - Under Renovation

** <b> For our purposes, a home is vacant if no one lives there.</b> ** 
<b><u>** People occupy properties, not their things. **</u></b>  

<b>Snowbird Property</b> - person only occupies seasonally

Partial Vacant refers to multi-family units like a duplex.  If one side of the duplex is vacant and the other side is occupied, 
 then this means that we would select “Partial Vacant” for the occupancy.

 Vacant properties require us to do a complete walk around the premises of the property, looking for damages and security of the property.  
  We are required to take photos of the rear, sides, detached garages, sheds that are on foundations, and outbuildings. Outbuildings include barns, 
  workshops, mother-in-law quarters, etc. We also check the security of these structures and report our findings on the inspection form as well as taking photos of padlocks in place.

 If you cannot enter the backyard of a property because of a locked gate, take a photo of the locked gate.

<b>PHOTO REQUIREMENTS</b>
CORE:
 - Front + Front Left + Front Right
 - Address Verification
 - Street Sign
 - Street Scene / Neighborhood view 

In addition to Core: 
 - Left Side of House
 - Right Side of House
 - Rear Of House
 - Roof (if weathered, damaged, or tarped)
 - Detached Garage
 - A/C Unit [Always]
 - Supporting (Through the Window shots to prove vacant)
 - Volt Stick (Non-Contact type)
 - Electric Meter (if digital)
 - Water Spigot (showing the water running or off)
 - Gas Meter valve (if on-site)
 - All Damages
 - FTV/Vacancy Posting (Client Based)
 - Vacancy Certification Form
 - Outbuildings
 - Swimming Pools and Gates to Swimming Pools
 - Violation Notices From the City  
 
 All vacant properties with swimming pools require photos of the pool as well as all gates leading to the pool. 
  Photos are required of gates that are locked or unlocked to help show critical liability hazards if unlocked.

 You will need a close-up photo of all violation postings from the city that indicate the grass needs cut or debris removal, etc. 
  Include the date, phone numbers, and point of contact on your report.
 
 The first time any property is found vacant, we have to prove it is vacant by taking photos through the window, 
  and by confirming the property is vacant by talking to a neighbor. We enter the neighbor’s address for verification. This 
  general rule also applies in reverse, if a property had previously been reported vacant, we have to find out who is now living there.

** <b>*ALL vacant properties require a First Time Vacant (FTV) / Vacancy posting or sticker attached to the front door or window and requires a photo of it. Which FTV/Vacancy posting to be posted to the property is determined by the client or the mortgage company providing us with the work order.  

    *If the property has been reported vacant previously but the FTV/Vacancy form is missing, we must post another one and take a photo of it.
    
    *If the FTV/Vacancy posting is the wrong one, the inspector must remove the wrong one and replace it with the correct one according to their instructions.
    
     
    
    Every vacant property MUST have an FTV/Vacancy form posted. Failure to do so will result in a Follow-Up which will require you to go back to the property and post one.</b> **

    - FTV/Vacancy postings can be found under the Resources tab on InspectorADE.

<b>When posting an FTV/Vacancy sheet, it is imperative that you do not tape the posting to painted surfaces that might damage the door once the tape is removed. Windows are the best place to tape the FTV/Vacancy forms.

    Vacancy Certifications [Required] are needed with every vacant property. Vacancy Certifications can be found in the InspectorADE website under the Resources tab.</b>   
       <i>The most common Follow-Up is for failure to upload a photo of the Vacancy Certification.  This document is NEVER posted to the front door.  This is simply a form that you fill out and take a photo of it.
          Some clients allow InspectorADE to use their finger form on the phone app.  You simply sign it with your finger.</i>

<b>**** If your work order has a work code of Bankruptcy, No-Contact, FIB or FINC, DO NOT PLACE an FTV/Vacancy posting on the property!    Even if the property is vacant, we are not to step foot on the property, not even 
     to post the FTV/Vacancy posting. In the case of a vacant No-Contact or Bankruptcy inspection, it means the photo requirement changes to just a few photos, front, address verification, street sign, and the street scene/neighborhood shot. 
     Plus anything that you can take a photo of that will help the mortgage company see that it is vacant. ****

    Under no circumstances are we authorized to enter a vacant property unless the work order tells you to. Many of your clients may require you to attempt an interior inspection on all vacant properties that are found to be vacant.
    
    *If you discover a property is vacant, and find that it is unsecured, do your best to reach around the door and lock it if you can.  If you find unsecured windows, take a photo of it and report the property to be unsecured (open).  
      We do not enter the property to secure windows unless explicitly told to do so.</b>       

 One of the most important photos you take at a vacant property is the water spigot. If the water is turned off, take a photo of the spigot with your hand on the handle.
    If the water is still on, take a photo of it to prove the water is still on.    

    If the gas meter is shut off, the valve or handle will be turned perpendicular to the pipe indicating that the gas has been turned off. Some gas meters will have two holes that line up so that a padlock can keep the gas locked off.  
     ** You need a photo of the position of the valve. **

** <b>REMINDER: If your work order has a work code of Bankruptcy, No-Contact, FIB or FINC, DO NOT STEP FOOT ON THE PROPERTY, NOT EVEN FOR PHOTOS. That means the photo requirement changes to the front, 
     address verification, street sign, and the street scene or neighborhood shot.</b>

 Take a photo of the Electricity meter on vacant properties. 
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/mortgagefieldservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/onOff_statusDisplay.jpg?w=500&ssl=1" alt="Open actually means OFF; Closed means On">    

Other types of digital meters will have the word “Delivered” if the power is on.
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/mortgagefieldservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SM21.jpg?resize=336%2C293&ssl=1" alt="showing delivered">

Some meters have arrows/boxes point right or flashing left to right that indicate the power is on

-- if you come across a meter with two arrows flashing in opposite directions then the power is 'OFF'

* If a photo of the digital meter cannot be obtained, use a volt stick to prove the status of the electricity at the property. *
** <b>Correct places to use Volt Sticks:

    The right side slot of an electrical outlet
    The wiring leading to an AC condensing unit
    The main breaker at the electrical panel (Do Not Remove Panel Covers!)</b>

One of the best places to test for electricity is on the wiring from the house to the outside AC condensing unit. 
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/mortgagefieldservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/best-place.jpg?w=921&ssl=1" alt="check the AC power line">
<h2>Lesson 09: Interior Inspections</h2>
<b>DO  NOT  ATTEMPT  TO  CONDUCT  AN  INTERIOR  INSPECTION  ON  AN  OCCUPIED  PROPERTY!</b>

PHOTO REQUIREMENTS
  Always take the Core photos as you would do on an occupancy inspection.
    - Front + Front Left + Front Right
    - Address
    - Street sign
    - Neighborhood

Take all the photos required for an exterior vacant property.

In addition, take these photos as well:
    - The 1/3 middle section of ALL exterior doors showing lockbox present or missing.
    - Close view of lockbox showing the combination tumblers that opened the lockbox.
    - Close up view of the key laying inside the lockbox.
    - Close up photo of the keycode that you entered the property with.
    - Every Room in the House (Some clients require ceilings or 2 photos of each room)
    - Open Toilet (Capture bowl and tank bottom in one shot)
    - Furnace
    - Hot Water Tank (Water Heater)
    - Kitchen appliances (one photo of the kitchen if it captures all appliances)
    - Sign In Sheet
    - Sump Pump (Usually found in the basement) with volt stick photo proving elect. on or off
    - Dehumidifiers (If onsite)
    - All Damages
    - Personal Property Items

3 photos pertaining to the entry of a property that is required when conducting an interior inspection.
    - The lockbox combination that opens the lockbox.
    - The keys inside the lockbox.
    - The keycode of the key while it is still in the door showing in the background that the key works and opened the door.
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/mortgagefieldservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lockboxpics.jpg?resize=771%2C295&ssl=1" alt="3 lockbox pics">

INTERIOR INSPECTIONS WITH NO MEANS OF ENTERING THE PROPERTY
    - The lockbox is no longer present.
    - The key has been removed from the lockbox.
    - The lockbox no longer opens with the combination that our Client provided.
    - Your keys do not open any of the doors.

1) If it seems that no lock-box is present:
    - Check all areas before reporting no lock-box—many times lock-boxes are installed on the rear or side door.
    - Check spigots, fences, gas meter, and other areas for the lock-box, as realtors may have moved it.
    - Photograph ALL doors to verify that the lock-box is not present. 
    
2) If the combination provided does not open the lockbox:
    Take a clear photo of the tumblers in the position of the combination that is provided from your work order, to prove that you attempted to open the box.

3) If the key from the lock-box does not work, or your client supplied keys do not work:
    Take a photo of the key in the knob lock showing the key was tried, but would not turn or unlock the door.   

4) If the key is missing from inside the lockbox:
    Take a photo of the lock-box key storage chamber to show that there is no key inside.    

** <b>Read the work order to see if the client requires a call from onsite if no entrance to the property is available using key codes or lockbox codes. </b> **

If a key code number has been provided on the work order form but your key does not open the door, take a close up photo of the key 
 in the door so that our client can read the key code number on the key. Do this for every door and for every key code listed.

Look around the entire house for roof leaks, mold, water damage, signs of vermin etc.  When you inspect a property always look under sinks, in closets, around the bathroom, 
 and around hot water tanks for mold and water damage. Take a flashlight in with you when doing so that way nothing is missed.

Gas leaks and water leaks require contact with the local utility company to have these services repaired or turned off. Then call your client or Account Manager to report the condition.
 
Take a photo of every room (excluding closets…unless damaged).  Make sure your kitchen photos show all the appliances. You can also take separate photos of the appliances, dishwasher, stove, etc.

Every bathroom and every toilet requires a photo. The photo of the toilet(s) is taken by standing over the toilet looking straight down so the picture captures the tank bottom and toilet 
 bowl all in one shot. If a toilet tank lid is present, remove it in order that the tank bottom can be seen in the photo.  The purpose of this photo is to show how much if any, anti-freeze 
 is present in the tank and bowl. It’s a good idea to wear latex gloves during interior inspections. Do Not break the plastic wrap or seal tape that may be around a toilet bowl. 
 If the toilet and tank are sealed with blue tape, do not break the seal.

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/mortgagefieldservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/overtoilet.jpg?resize=336%2C252&ssl=1" alt="toilet shot">

Take a photo of the sign-in sheet after you add your name to it. Enter your client’s name and your initials.
 You can find all client specific sign-in sheets in the Resources tab in InspectorADE website. 

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/mortgagefieldservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/signinsheet.jpg?resize=336%2C253&ssl=1" alt="sign in sheet">

Take photos of personal property that you feel has a value of $100 or more. (Garage Sale Value)
   Provide proof photos of any debris, garbage, junk or trash.

** <b>Take photos of all mold present at the property.  Any mold less than a 2×2 square foot area places the interior of the property in Fair condition. 
        Mold that has expanded further than 2 square feet is considered Poor condition.  
     
      In the Comment section of the report, write: “Existing mold present, health hazard.”</b>   

<b><i>Tip:  Mark the upper right corner of the sign-in sheet with a list of the appliance(s) onsite.  
        By doing so you’ll remember what to look for during the next visit.  Also, if you get back to your car and forgot what appliances are there, just take a look at your sign-in sheet photo.

    Tip:  Mark somewhere on the sign-in sheet all the damages or mold issues.  These have to be reported each and every time an inspection occurs. 
        If you marked it down once, and then forget on your next visit, you will get a Follow-Up to make you go back.
    
    Tip:  Entering the lock box code that works onto the work order form, under Property Notes, saves time on your next visit.</i></b>

** DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING FROM VACANT PROPERTIES **
<h2>Lesson 10: Insurance Loss Inspections</h2>
<b>Work Codes:
    [LOSS DRAFT, INSURANCE LOSS, IL, CONSTRUCTION DRAW, PROPERTY DAMAGE INSPECTION]</b>

<b>PHOTO REQUIREMENT: 
    - The 4 core photos
    - Photos of all completed repairs according to the Scope of Work
    - Photos of all unfinished or incomplete repairs according to the Scope of Work
    - A photo of the signature page that the homeowner signs
    
 The Six Most Important Parts to an IL Inspection:
    1. MAKE PHONE CALLS TO THE CONTACT PERSON ON THE INSURANCE FORM!
    2. Make the appointment with the homeowner within the first 1 to 6 hours of receiving the work order. (No calls before 8 AM and not after 9 PM)
    3. Take photos of all completed repairs as well as those not completed.
    4. Calculate the percentage of completion based on the Scope of Work.
    5. Get the homeowner to sign the Insurance Loss form.  Some call it a homeowner’s satisfaction form.
    6. Snap a photo of the insurance form they homeowner signed and upload it with all the other photos.</b>    

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/mortgagefieldservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Form-Photos.png?resize=768%2C539&ssl=1" alt="correct form photo">

<b>Setting the Appointment</b>
Every call attempt must be documented in the Info/Comments tab on the website version of InspectorADE.  
 (You cannot do this on the InspectorADE cellphone app.) You can, however, use your cell phone to go to the InspectorADEwebsite, login, and then make your updates on the website version.

The quickest way to get your clients upset at you is by not making calls and setting insurance loss appointments with the homeowner.
 Every day make at least one phone call attempt. The next day try the AM, then the PM. Alternate your times that you call each day. 
  Enter your attempts on the work order of InspectorADE. 

If the phone numbers provided are disconnected or no longer in service, you must inform your Vendor Manager immediately so they can attempt to get new phone numbers for you.  

<b><i>Tip: When speaking to the homeowner, just say ‘Your mortgage company wanted me to come by and take some photos of the completed repairs. Is everything 100% finished or are they still working on it?‘.  
    If the repairs won’t be completely finished until next Tuesday, then maybe it would be best to set the appointment up for Wednesday or the following day. </i></b>

The “due date” will change to whatever you set the appointment for.   

Once your appointment is set, write and record it in this format:
    <i>Appt. set for Thurs, 4/29 @ 9 AM.</i>

Call the homeowner for an appointment as soon as possible.  
  It’s not when the appointment is scheduled for, it’s all about setting the appointment for a future date.    

Sometimes the contractor will ask for a draw inspection. 
  - In that case, we are there to determine the percentage of completion as it relates to the entire Scope of Work.   
        Is the work 50% complete, 75%, 90%? 
    In cases like this, take photos of the completed repairs, AS WELL AS ALL UNCOMPLETED REPAIRS!  


<b>ROOFS</b>
When a roof is replaced, the contractor will install a new drip edge. The drip edge helps prevent water from entering underneath the shingle edges which would damage the roof over time. The drip edge when installed new or before painted is often stainless steel or aluminum. It may still be shiny and can be easily seen. 
    This is a good photo to take to help show that the roof has been replaced.

<b>We do not proceed with a roof inspection if the roof is covered by snow. We have to be able to see the roof. 
     In cases like this, the homeowner will have to wait until the snow melts for their inspection.</b>    

     Whenever we encounter a situation where the old roof shingles were not removed, and new shingles were placed on top of the old shingles, this should be well documented.  In most cases, the Scope of Work from the insurance company is paying for the old shingles to be removed.     

<b>** Download and print the form/instructions and Scope of Work (list of repairs) from InspectorADE in the work order which will appear as an attachment. The homeowner needs to sign it. **</b>     
<b><i>Every inspection has to be signed by the homeowner (unless the client does not require it for roof inspections) or unless your client otherwise states that you have permission to allow the contractor to sign it.</i></b>


<b>SOW – SCOPE OF WORK (LIST OF REPAIRS)</b>
The “Scope of Work” is what most mortgage companies call the document from the insurance company that lists all the repairs that are to be completed.  
  Others call it an Itemized List of Repairs

<i>Example Math:  If the ACV (Actual Cash Value) total for the repairs is $18,969 and you determined that $14,388 worth of repairs have been completed so far, simply take the smaller number and divide it by the larger number: 

    14,388 ÷ 18,969 which equals .7585 or 76% complete.   
    
    Depending on the client, some forms will allow you to put whole numbers like 76, while others will only allow you to enter percentages as multiples of 5. (75, 80, 85, 90, etc.)  In that case, round it to the nearest number.</i>

<b>Special Things to Take Note of:</b>
    - Materials on the job-site do NOT constitute a repair. A stack of sheet-rock is NOT a repair. It’s a stack of sheet-rock.
    - We can NEVER sign our name for the homeowner.  In most cases, we have to get permission from our client if the contractor can sign it in place of the homeowner.
    - Completed and signed IL forms must be scanned as a .jpg file or PDF file.  Some clients allow you to take close up photos of the form. Every client is different.
    - Do not provide copies to the homeowner.  If a homeowner asks for a copy, inform them that the mortgage company will provide them with any copies they ask for by calling them.
    - We never tell the homeowner when they will receive their money or when they can even expect to see their money.  We do not have this information.  Never guess or provide a procedure other than the fact that you conduct the inspection and turn it into the client.  It’s up to the mortgage company to handle the documents from there.
    - Always take photos of all repairs whether completed or not.  It is just as important to show the work that has not been repaired yet.
    - If you are on the 2nd inspection for the homeowner, and they tell you the other rooms were already inspected and paid for, if the SOW has it on there, we have to take photos of it.    
<h2>Lesson 11: Taking the Next Step</h2>
Be Prepared for these things:
    - Most companies nowadays, after the passing of the Dodd/Frank bill in Congress about 10 years ago, now require a criminal background check that the Independent Contractor is expected to pay for themselves. This is not an ordinary background check. You will receive a special code or number that is attached to all your completed inspections. 
       This number is then verified through the background check company for validation. Your Aspen Grove background check can be used for all companies you work for. You don’t have to keep buying it for each company you work for. Once you receive your ABC# you can use it for all of your clients.
    
    - Keys to enter vacant properties are considered “tools” that as an Independent Contractor, you must provide. Many companies will have a list of keycodes based on your particular state that you would need to obtain.  
       Most Regional companies that hire you will have a way for you to purchase your keys through them.  That is the best way since they buy in bulk and the price is usually less than $20 bucks.
    
    - The fees per inspection vary from company to company and by the type of inspection being conducted.
 
    - Keep in mind that you will work as an Independent Contractor, not an employee.  You are free to seek out and work for as many companies (clients) as will hire you.  If you were a dog groomer you would need more than one dog a week to groom.  You may need multiple dogs, er, companies to work for to make this work.  
      This is YOUR business, not employment. if you only want a 9 to 5 job, then I’m surprised you made it this far.  You need that entrepreneur mindset. Develop and expand your business and make it work.
 
    - As an Independent Contractor, you are authorized to take all the tax deductions that any other business is allowed to take.  Your cell phone bill, internet, new cell phone, printer ink, paper, the office use of your home, are all examples of tax deductions.  By far, however, your largest tax deduction will be your mileage.  
      While you may be making $10 to $50 an hour, you’ll have to pay income taxes yourself on all of that money.  Keeping up with your mileage at .58 cents (or whatever the current rate is) adds up quickly! Make sure you get yourself an app that helps track all those miles, like MileIQ.
