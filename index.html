<h1>National Mortgage Field Services</h1>    
<h2>Lesson 01: What Does a Field Inspector Do?</h2>
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never ask or inquire of the homeowner about the financial status of the loan.
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never collect or insist on payments be made.
    - Reasons for delinquency are not the responsibility of the Mortgage Field Service inspector.
    - Leaving a letter in a sealed envelope at the door for the homeowner to call the mortgage company may be required.
    - Some inspections are ordered simply to check for damages in a declared natural disaster area.

  Exterior property inspections are requested by the bank or mortgage company to determine:
    - The occupancy status
    - The condition of the property
    - If there is any deterioration or vandalism
    - If the property has been abandoned
    - If the property is listed for sale
