<h1>National Mortgage Field Services</h1>    
<h2>Lesson 01: What Does a Field Inspector Do?</h2>
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never ask or inquire of the homeowner about the financial status of the loan.
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never collect or insist on payments be made.
    - Reasons for delinquency are not the responsibility of the Mortgage Field Service inspector.
    - Leaving a letter in a sealed envelope at the door for the homeowner to call the mortgage company may be required.
    - Some inspections are ordered simply to check for damages in a declared natural disaster area.

  Exterior property inspections are requested by the bank or mortgage company to determine:
    - The occupancy status
    - The condition of the property
    - If there is any deterioration or vandalism
    - If the property has been abandoned
    - If the property is listed for sale 


** Your mileage, your cell phone, your cell phone bill, your internet bill, the square footage of the room in your home where you set up your office, are all tax deductions just like any other business. **    
<h2>Lesson 02: The Mortgage Field Service Industry</h2>

   Tools to be successful:
    - A vehicle that gets good gas mileage.
    - A SmartPhone (Android or iPhone)
    - A Printer/Scanner
    - A Computer (Desktop, Tablet, Laptop, or your cell phone if you can print from it)
    - A Volt stick to check electricity at vacant properties – costs about $10
    - A set of HUD keys. Your client may be able to sell these to you at a very low-cost.
    - A clean criminal background record. (No Felony convictions) As an Independent Contractor, you will have to pay for this yourself.

** Never go to the backyards of occupied properties, no matter what the instructions tell you.  **

<b>A Mortgage Field Service Inspector does not engage in any debt or money collection services whatsoever. </b>

use of <b>InspectorADE</b> application on phone

<h2>Lesson 03: The Basic Property Inspection</h2>
 It may be occupied if:
    - the doorbell is lit or porch light is on.
    - a water spigot near the front door when turn on has water coming out of it.
    - noises coming from the interior.
    - garbage cans set out for collection along with all the neighbors.
    - freshly cut and manicured lawns.
    - cars parked in the driveway.
    - personal property is seen on the exterior.
    - personal property is seen in the interior from the street.
    - holiday decorations.
    - flags or political signs.
    - pets or animals on the property.

*Never walk in the backyard of an occupied property!
** DO NOT knock on the front door of a Bankruptcy / No-Contact Inspection **
**** NEVER MENTION ****
    -- Late on Payments
    -- Delinquency
    -- Past Due
    -- Default
    -- In the rears
    -- FORECLOSURE

 It may be vacant if:
   - weeds are growing in the cracks of the driveway
   - all utilities appear to be off
   - tall grass or weeds
   - no signs of personal property
   - no window coverings
   - excess debris
   - newspapers and mail piled up

Steps to determining if occupied or not: 
    - Ring the doorbell, listen for sounds. If there is an electrical outlet near the front door, use your volt stick to check for power.
    - If there is a water spigot near the front door, see if the water is on or off.
    - Listen to the AC unit.
    - If the electric meter is on the side of the house in public view, see if it is operating.

 Examples of “No Access” would be:
   - A closed rural gate where you cannot see over the gate to get a view of the dwelling. If you can see the dwelling over the gate, then you have access.
   - (We do not open road gates.) Take a photo of the gate, and another of what is seen beyond the gate to show you cannot see the dwelling.
   - A gated community when you cannot get past the guard or it requires a code to open the gate.  That would be No Access.

 <b>Disaster Inspections</b>  
    Hurricane, Tornado, Wildfires, Earthquake, and Floods

 ** Under no circumstances are you to take photos of the interior of occupied properties, even if the homeowner invites you in. **   
 If the homeowner doesn’t want you taking photos of their property then don’t argue with them. Finish your report, make notes, and move on.
