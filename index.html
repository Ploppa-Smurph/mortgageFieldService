<h1>National Mortgage Field Services</h1>    
<h2>Lesson 01: What Does a Field Inspector Do?</h2>
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never ask or inquire of the homeowner about the financial status of the loan.
    - Mortgage Field Service inspectors never collect or insist on payments be made.
    - Reasons for delinquency are not the responsibility of the Mortgage Field Service inspector.
    - Leaving a letter in a sealed envelope at the door for the homeowner to call the mortgage company may be required.
    - Some inspections are ordered simply to check for damages in a declared natural disaster area.

  Exterior property inspections are requested by the bank or mortgage company to determine:
    - The occupancy status
    - The condition of the property
    - If there is any deterioration or vandalism
    - If the property has been abandoned
    - If the property is listed for sale 


** Your mileage, your cell phone, your cell phone bill, your internet bill, the square footage of the room in your home where you set up your office, are all tax deductions just like any other business. **    
<h2>Lesson 02: The Mortgage Field Service Industry</h2>

   Tools to be successful:
    - A vehicle that gets good gas mileage.
    - A SmartPhone (Android or iPhone)
    - A Printer/Scanner
    - A Computer (Desktop, Tablet, Laptop, or your cell phone if you can print from it)
    - A Volt stick to check electricity at vacant properties – costs about $10
    - A set of HUD keys. Your client may be able to sell these to you at a very low-cost.
    - A clean criminal background record. (No Felony convictions) As an Independent Contractor, you will have to pay for this yourself.

** Never go to the backyards of occupied properties, no matter what the instructions tell you.  **

<b>A Mortgage Field Service Inspector does not engage in any debt or money collection services whatsoever. </b>

use of <b>InspectorADE</b> application on phone

 * Inspections on occupied properties cannot be conducted before 8 AM and not after 9 PM.

<h2>Lesson 03: The Basic Property Inspection</h2>
 It may be occupied if:
    - the doorbell is lit or porch light is on.
    - a water spigot near the front door when turn on has water coming out of it.
    - noises coming from the interior.
    - garbage cans set out for collection along with all the neighbors.
    - freshly cut and manicured lawns.
    - cars parked in the driveway.
    - personal property is seen on the exterior.
    - personal property is seen in the interior from the street.
    - holiday decorations.
    - flags or political signs.
    - pets or animals on the property.

*Never walk in the backyard of an occupied property!
** DO NOT knock on the front door of a Bankruptcy / No-Contact Inspection **
**** NEVER MENTION ****
    -- Late on Payments
    -- Delinquency
    -- Past Due
    -- Default
    -- In the rears
    -- FORECLOSURE

 It may be vacant if:
   - weeds are growing in the cracks of the driveway
   - all utilities appear to be off
   - tall grass or weeds
   - no signs of personal property
   - no window coverings
   - excess debris
   - newspapers and mail piled up

Steps to determining if occupied or not: 
    - Ring the doorbell, listen for sounds. If there is an electrical outlet near the front door, use your volt stick to check for power.
    - If there is a water spigot near the front door, see if the water is on or off.
    - Listen to the AC unit.
    - If the electric meter is on the side of the house in public view, see if it is operating.

 Examples of “No Access” would be:
   - A closed rural gate where you cannot see over the gate to get a view of the dwelling. If you can see the dwelling over the gate, then you have access.
   - (We do not open road gates.) Take a photo of the gate, and another of what is seen beyond the gate to show you cannot see the dwelling.
   - A gated community when you cannot get past the guard or it requires a code to open the gate.  That would be No Access.

 <b>Disaster Inspections</b>  
    Hurricane, Tornado, Wildfires, Earthquake, and Floods

 ** Under no circumstances are you to take photos of the interior of occupied properties, even if the homeowner invites you in. **   
 If the homeowner doesn’t want you taking photos of their property then don’t argue with them. Finish your report, make notes, and move on.  

 -- If the property is occupied, all occupancy and letter delivery inspections require at least 2 additional photos that support that the property is occupied. (Along with the 4 core photos.)
        <i>Car in Driveway, porch light, trash can day, personal property, lawn cut, pet in window, etc... </i>
<h2>Lesson 04: No-Contact and Bankruptcy Inspections</h2> 
<b>WHO EVER SPEAKS FIRST LOSES!</b>
    - If you are inspecting an occupied property and it is a No-Contact or Bankruptcy inspection and the occupant comes out and you say hello first, you just made contact!
        If on the other hand the occupant of the property comes out during your inspection asking what are you doing then they made contact with you which is not in violation with any bankruptcy laws. 
        - If they ask what you are doing you are authorized to say that you are conducting a property inspection for the mortgage company. If they ask anything else, tell them that you are not authorized to have this conversation, 
           (or not provided with that information), you’re just conducting a property inspection.
       
   * Every bankruptcy that involves the mortgage will be inspected once a month for the duration of the bankruptcy.  It is in every bankruptcy settlement written. *
   
<b>DO NOT STEP FOOT ON THE PROPERTY!</b>
   Even if it is vacant, we do not step foot on the property.  Take your photos from the street and leave.  If you are not sure if it is occupied or vacant, make your best guess.  We are not held accountable for judgment calls on bankruptcy and No-Contact inspections.  

   - In the comments section of the inspection form you can write:  “All observations made from roadside.”

  ** Do NOT leave door hangers, cards, envelopes, vacancy stickers, vacancy postings or any other postings on a property when the work code shows: No-Contact or Bankruptcy. **   
<h2>Lesson 05: Inspection Authority</h2>
Where do we get the authority to do what we do? 

In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, 

§ 203.377 Inspection and preservation of properties.

The mortgagee, (the bank or mortgage company) upon learning that a property subject to a mortgage insured under this part is vacant or abandoned, shall be responsible for the inspection of such property at least monthly, if the loan thereon is in default. When a mortgage is in default and a payment thereon is not received within 45 days of the due date,
  and efforts to reach the mortgagor by telephone within that period have been unsuccessful, the mortgagee shall be responsible for a visual inspection of the security property to determine whether the property is vacant. The mortgagee shall take reasonable action to protect and preserve such security property when it is determined or should have been 
  determined to be vacant or abandoned until its conveyance to the Secretary, if such action does not constitute an illegal trespass. ‘‘Reasonable action’’ includes the commencement of foreclosure within the time required by § 203.355(b) of this part.

** The best practice is to take the photo of the street sign first, before pulling up to the property. While you have your inspection open on your phone, and ready for the next photo, arrive at the property so that the house is on your left side. Have your window already rolled down. 
    As you pull up across the street, start snapping those photos before anyone comes out. Get the front, or in some cases, the front left, front, front right. (Depending on the client instructions.) Then zoom in on the address.  Hit your occupancy photos, cat in the window, toys in the yard, swing on the porch etc. **

    No need for getting out of your car. (Even though most companies will tell you not to take photos from your car) No need to cause a scene.

<b>No Tresspassing</b>    
Properties with “No Trespassing” signs can and often are treated in the same way as “no contact” inspections.

<b><i>In Louisiana, Title 14, RS 14:63 – Criminal Trespass Section F Shows person is not trespassing when:
  (3) Any person making a delivery, soliciting, selling any product or service, conducting a survey or poll, a real estate licensee or other person who has a legitimate reason for making a delivery, conducting business or communicating with the owner, lessee, custodian or a resident of the immovable property, 
  and who, immediately upon entry, seeks to make the delivery, to conduct business or to conduct the communication.</i></b>
